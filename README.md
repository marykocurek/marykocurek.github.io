<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<p>Hi! My name is Mary. I am a freshman at the University of Texas and I made this website for my MIS class. When I am not in class I enjoy spending time with friends and family and trying new restaurants. My favorite restaurants in Austin include Mattâ€™s El Rancho and Z Tejas. I hope you click the link to my favorite site, Netflix and find something to watch over the summer that is fast approaching us! I suggest watching The Office and New Girl to get you started. Enjoy my site. Thanks for visiting! <br /><br /></p>
