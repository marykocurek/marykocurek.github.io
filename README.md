<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<p> Hi! Thanks for visiting my site! I am a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin. I grew up in Austin, Texas and I am glad I get to go to college here. My favorite things to do include spending time with friends and family, watching movies, and cooking. I made this site from some super confusing code that I learned about in my MIS class. The class is fun and interesting and I am learning a lot. <br /><br /></p>
